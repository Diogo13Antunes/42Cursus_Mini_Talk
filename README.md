## Requirements

## How to create a Main for Get Next Line

> To use this function you need to create a main like this.

    #include "get_next_line.h"
    #include "get_next_line_bonus.h"
    #include <fcntl.h>

    int main(void)
    {
        int     fd = -1;
        char    *line;
    
        fd = open([FILENAME], O_RDONLY);
        line = get_next_line(fd);
        printf("%s", line);
        free(line);
        close (fd);
    }

> Do not forget to close the file descriptor (fd) and free the dynamically allocated returned line.
